# Pocket Detection

Note: 
- Local files are not directly accessible by the server. Please upload them to the server using `molclaw-file-transfer` before execution. 
- For PDB file inputs, it is recommended to preprocess them using `molclaw-pdbfixer` before execution.
- Please refer to skill `molclaw-scp-server` to complete tool invocation.

The description of tool *fpocket_toolkit*.

```tex
Detect binding pockets in a protein structure using fpocket_toolkit.
Args:
    pdb_file (str): Input PDB/mmCIF file path to scan for pockets (required)
    top_n (int): Limit returned pockets to the top N by druggability score; 0 means return all (default: 0)
    min_druggability (float | None): Filter out pockets below this druggability threshold (0.0~1.0); None means no filter (default: None)
    verbose (bool): Request verbose descriptor parsing during the run for detailed logging (default: False)
Return:
    status (str): 'success' or 'error'
    msg (str): Human-readable narrative about the run
    run_dir (str): Absolute directory storing this run's results
    output_dir (str): Path where fpocket preserved its raw outputs
    pockets (List[Dict[str, Any]]): Parsed pocket descriptors, including scores, centers, and residue contacts
    pocket_count (int): Number of pockets returned after filtering
    output_files (Dict[str, str]): Preserved fpocket output files such as info, pymol scripts, etc.
    exported (Dict[str, str] | None): Export metadata when export_path is provided
    files (Dict[str, str]): All files created under the run_dir
```

How to use tool *fpocket_toolkit* :

Invoke `mcp__DrugSDA-Tool__fpocket_toolkit` with the arguments documented above; use the result fields `pockets`.

Here is an example of a pocket from *pred_pockets*:

After detecting the pockets, please comprehensively evaluate their various properties to **select the optimal binding site** for small-molecule ligands.



**Note**: The input protein structure file should be repaired before running fpocket.
