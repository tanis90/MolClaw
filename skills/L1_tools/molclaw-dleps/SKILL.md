The description of tool *calculate_dleps_score*.

```tex
Enter a list of candidate small molecules. Based on the input disease name, identify upregulated and downregulated genes associated with the disease state, and predict a reversal score for each small molecule. Generally, a score above 0.2 indicates effectiveness, with higher scores being better.
Args:
    smiles_list (List[str]): List of input SMILES strings, (e.g., ["N[C@@H](Cc1ccc(O)cc1)C(=O)O", "CC(C)C1=CC=CC=C1"])
    disease_name (str): Supportes diseases, e.g., "Aging", "Gout", "Pulmonary fibrosis", "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease", "Obesity" 
Return:
    status (str): success/error
    msg (str): message
    pred_scores (List[dict]): List of dict, each containing the keys 'smiles' and 'cs_score'. 
        --smiles (str): A SMILES string of smiles_list 
        --cs_score (float): Predicted reverse score
```

How to use tool *calculate_dleps_score* :

Invoke `mcp__DrugSDA-Tool__calculate_dleps_score` with the arguments documented above; use the result fields `pred_scores`.
