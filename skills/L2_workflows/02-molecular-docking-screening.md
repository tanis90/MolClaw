# Molecular Docking Virtual Screening Workflow

## Applicability

**Use this skill when:** The user provides a target protein (any form) and small molecules (SMILES/names/files), and requests molecular docking, virtual screening, binding assessment, or ranking molecules by predicted binding affinity.

**Do NOT use this skill when:** The user only needs property filtering without docking (use Skill 3); the task is peptide-protein or protein-protein docking (use Skill 9 or Skill 11); or the user already has docking results and only wants post-hoc evaluation (use Skill 8).

**Boundary with Skill 8:** This skill handles the full pipeline from raw inputs to ranked results. If you already have docking output files (PDBQT poses, SDF complexes) and need only rescoring/consensus/SAR analysis, use Skill 8 instead.

## Prerequisites

| Input | Source | Required? |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Prepared protein PDB | Skill 1 `prepared_pdb` | Yes |
| Quality summary | Skill 1 `quality_summary` | Recommended (for reporting) |
| Numbering scheme info | Skill 1 `numbering_scheme` | Recommended (for residue-specific analysis) |
| Molecule SMILES list | User input or upstream generation | Yes |

## Phase 1: Scale Assessment and Strategy Selection

**This is the most critical decision point.** Before any computation, count the molecules and select the screening strategy using the following decision tree:

| Library size | Strategy | Tiers | Rationale |
|-------------|----------|-------|-----------|
| **≤ 10 molecules** | Full evaluation | Direct docking + EquiScore + interaction analysis for all | Small enough for exhaustive analysis |
| **11–100 molecules** | Two-tier screening | Tier 1: property pre-filter → Tier 2: dock survivors | Balance efficiency and coverage |
| **101–500 molecules** | Three-tier screening | Tier 1: property filter → Tier 2: docking → Tier 3: EquiScore + interaction analysis for Top 15–20 | Standard virtual screening |
| **501–2000 molecules** | Four-tier screening | Tier 1: strict property filter → Tier 2: Boltz-2 rapid binding probability → Tier 3: dock Top 100 → Tier 4: EquiScore + interaction analysis for Top 15 | Large-scale campaign |
| **> 2000 molecules** | Recommend KarmaDock or stricter pre-filter | Advise user to use KarmaDock for initial screening or provide stricter filtering criteria to reduce the library | QuickVina's per-molecule MCP calls would be too slow |

Record the chosen strategy and rationale in `run_log.md`.

## Phase 2: Small Molecule Acquisition and Preparation

**Step 1 — Obtain SMILES.** Compound names → `retrieve_smiles_by_compoundname`; direct SMILES → use directly; mixed input → validate with `is_valid_smiles` to classify.

**Step 2 — Validate.** Call `is_valid_smiles` for every molecule. Remove invalid entries; record them in the screening funnel log.

**⚠ COUNT GATE (L3 Principle 11 — MANDATORY):** After validation, programmatically count valid molecules:
```python
# Example: count valid SMILES in the list
valid_count = sum(1 for s in smiles_list if is_valid)
```
Record: "Input: X molecules → Valid: Y molecules → Invalid: Z molecules (reasons: ...)". The count Y must come from the actual validation results, not from memory or expectation.

**Step 3 — Property pre-filter (if strategy requires it).** Call `calculate_mol_drug_chemistry` for QED and Lipinski violations. Apply the following default thresholds (adjust if user specifies otherwise):

| Criterion | Default threshold | When to relax |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| Lipinski violations | ≤ 2 | Natural products, PROTACs, macrocycles: skip this filter |
| QED | ≥ 0.2 | Fragment screening: lower to 0.1 |
| MW | 150–900 Da | Peptide-like molecules: raise upper bound |

**⚠ COUNT GATE after filtering:** Programmatically count how many molecules passed. Record: "Pre-filter input: Y molecules → Passed: P molecules → Eliminated: Y-P molecules (Lipinski>2: A; QED<0.2: B; MW out of range: C)".

**Step 4 — Format conversion.** Call `convert_smiles_to_format` (SMILES → PDBQT for QuickVina). Record conversion failures.

**⚠ COUNT GATE after conversion:** Count successful conversions. Record: "Conversion input: P molecules → Successful: Q molecules → Failed: P-Q molecules".

## Phase 3: Pocket Detection

**Decision: Is detection needed?**
- User provided pocket center coordinates → use directly.
- User specified active site residues → still run detection, select the pocket closest to the specified residues.
- **Co-crystal ligand available in the PDB** → extract ligand centroid as box center (see below).
- No pocket information → detection is mandatory.

### Co-Crystal Ligand Centroid Extraction (when applicable)

**When the original PDB contains a co-crystal ligand** (e.g., AQ4 in 1M17, ligand residue name visible in HETATM records) **and the task specifies using the native ligand position as the docking box center**, extract the ligand centroid **BEFORE running fix_pdb** (which removes heterogens and would delete the ligand):

```python
# Step 1: Parse HETATM records for the co-crystal ligand BEFORE fix_pdb
import re
ligand_coords = []
with open("raw_protein.pdb") as f:
    for line in f:
        if line.startswith("HETATM"):
            resname = line[17:20].strip()
            element = line[76:78].strip() if len(line) > 76 else ""
            if resname == "AQ4" and element != "H":  # Replace AQ4 with actual ligand name
                x = float(line[30:38])
                y = float(line[38:46])
                z = float(line[46:54])
                ligand_coords.append((x, y, z))

# Step 2: Compute centroid
center_x = sum(c[0] for c in ligand_coords) / len(ligand_coords)
center_y = sum(c[1] for c in ligand_coords) / len(ligand_coords)
center_z = sum(c[2] for c in ligand_coords) / len(ligand_coords)

# Step 3: Record these BEFORE fix_pdb removes the ligand
# These become the locked docking box center for all subsequent rounds
```

**⚠ Order of operations is critical:** Extract ligand centroid → THEN run fix_pdb (remove heterogens) → THEN proceed with docking. If fix_pdb is run first, the ligand coordinates are lost.

### Docking Parameter Locking (for iterative tasks)

**When the task involves iterative docking across multiple rounds with consistent parameters:**
After the baseline docking, record the EXACT parameters used in `run_log.md`:

```
## Locked Docking Parameters
- center_x: [value]
- center_y: [value]
- center_z: [value]
- size_x: [value]
- size_y: [value]
- size_z: [value]
- Established in: Step (a) baseline docking
- Rule: Use these EXACT parameters in ALL subsequent rounds. Do NOT re-detect pocket.
```

In all subsequent rounds, retrieve and reuse these locked parameters. **Do NOT re-run pocket detection** — the pocket does not change between rounds; only the ligand changes.

**Dual-tool detection (L3 Principle 3, when no co-crystal ligand is available).** Run both `fpocket_toolkit` and `pred_pocket_prank` on `prepared_pdb`.

**Consensus logic:**

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Top-1 pockets within 5 Å of each other | High confidence. Use fpocket coordinates. |
| 5–10 Å apart | Moderate confidence. Use the midpoint. |
| ≥ 10 Å apart | **Divergence.** Report both pockets. Use the one with the higher druggability score by default, but note the alternative in the report. |

### Docking Box Size (L3 Principle 18 — HARD CONSTRAINT)

**Minimum docking box size: 25.0 Å per dimension.** This is a non-negotiable floor.

| Scenario | Box size rule |
|----------|--------------|
| Pocket detection returns dimensions ≥ 25 Å | Use detected dimensions |
| Pocket detection returns any dimension < 25 Å | **Override to 25.0 Å** on that dimension |
| Large molecules (MW > 600) or shallow pockets | Increase to 30–35 Å |
| User specifies custom box size < 25 Å | **Override to 25.0 Å** and note in log |

**⚠ NEVER set size_x, size_y, or size_z below 25.0 Å.** A box that is too small will miss valid binding poses, clip the ligand search space, or cause the docking engine to return errors/positive scores.

**Pocket center sanity check:** If pocket center coordinates are (0, 0, 0) or appear to be default/unset values, suspect pocket detection failure — rerun detection or use the co-crystal ligand centroid as the pocket center.

## Phase 4: Receptor Format Conversion

Call `convert_pdb_to_pdbqt_dock` on `prepared_pdb`. If it fails, re-run `fix_pdb` with `replace_nonstandard=True` and retry once.

### Post-Conversion Download (L3 Principle 14)

Download the receptor PDBQT file to local workspace. This is a Category B file (diagnostic/reproducibility value).

<!-- NEW: Optional LR known binder retrieval -->
### Optional: Known Binder Retrieval (if LR tools are available)

Before docking execution, search for experimentally validated binders of the target to use as positive controls:

1. PubMed search: `"[target name] inhibitor IC50"` or `"[target name] crystal structure ligand"` (retmax=10)
2. If known binders are found with published binding data:
   - Retrieve their SMILES via `compound_retrieve` (by compound name) and include them in the docking run alongside the task's candidate molecules.
   - Their docking scores serve as **internal validation benchmarks** — if a known nanomolar binder docks with a poor score (positive or near zero), the docking setup (box position, receptor conformation) may need troubleshooting.
   - Record in `run_log.md`: `[LR] Known binder controls: [compound names with PMID]. Purpose: docking validation (Principle 9).`
3. This directly supports L3 Principle 9 (cross-validation) and Principle 13 Level 4 (proper literature citation).

**If LR tools are not available**, skip this step. Proceed to Phase 5.

## Phase 5: Docking Execution

**Primary method — QuickVina2.** For each ligand, call `molecule_docking_quickvina_fullprocess`. Collect `docking_affinity_value` (kcal/mol, more negative = better) and `docking_file`.

### Checkpoint A — Immediate Sanity Check After Each Docking (L3 Principle 12)

After EACH individual docking call, verify:

| Check | Condition | Action on failure |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Score sign | `docking_affinity_value` < 0 | If positive → **docking failure**. Do NOT silently accept. Execute progressive box enlargement (see below). |
| Score magnitude | `docking_affinity_value` > −15.0 for standard drug-like molecules | Flag as "anomalous — possible oversized ligand or box error" |
| Output file | `docking_file` exists and is non-empty | If missing → docking crashed, retry with larger box |

### Progressive Box Enlargement on Failure (L3 Principle 18)

If any docking returns an error, a positive score, or no valid pose:

| Retry # | Box size (each dimension) | Action |
|---------|--------------------------|--------|
| 0 (initial) | max(25, detected_size) | Standard attempt |
| 1 | 30 Å | If initial fails |
| 2 | 40 Å | If retry 1 fails |
| 3 | 47.625 Å | If retry 2 fails; current QuickVina2-GPU maximum |
| 4 (fallback) | — | Switch to KarmaDock |

Log every retry attempt and its outcome in `run_log.md`. If ALL molecules in a batch fail docking, the problem is likely in receptor preparation — check receptor format and box definition.

### Mandatory Pose Download (L3 Principle 14 — CRITICAL)

**After EACH successful docking, download the docking pose file:**

```python
# Download docking pose PDBQT for each molecule
response = await client.session.call_tool(
    "server_file_to_base64",
    arguments={"file_path": result["docking_file"]}
)
dl = client.parse_result(response)
local_path = f"step{N}_mol{i:02d}_docking_pose.pdbqt"
with open(local_path, "wb") as f:
    f.write(base64.b64decode(dl["base64_string"]))
# Verify: os.path.getsize(local_path) > 0
```

**A docking step is NOT considered complete until the pose file has been downloaded and verified.** These pose files are Category A (user-critical) outputs — they are essential for downstream analysis, user verification, and visualization.

**Supplementary methods (when to use):**
- **DiffDock:** The `diffdock_auto` tool is not deployed on the current MCP server and must not be called. If the user supplies external DiffDock results, its confidence score is valid only for comparing poses of the same molecule, never for ranking different molecules.
- **Boltz-2 rapid screen:** Use when a fast "can it bind?" filter is needed before expensive docking (Tier 2 in the four-tier strategy). Returns binding probability and predicted log₁₀(IC₅₀). **Download the complex CIF file** from Boltz-2 output (`complex_cif_file` field).

## Phase 6: Result Ranking and Evaluation

### COUNT GATE Before Ranking (L3 Principle 11 — MANDATORY)

Before constructing any ranking table, programmatically count:
- Total molecules that entered docking: `count_entered`
- Molecules that docked successfully (negative score): `count_success`
- Molecules that failed docking (positive/missing score): `count_failed`

```python
# Verify counts match actual data files
import json
scores = json.load(open("docking_results.json"))  # or however stored
count_success = sum(1 for s in scores.values() if s < 0)
count_failed = len(scores) - count_success
```

Record verified counts in `run_log.md`: "Docking: Q molecules attempted → S docked successfully → F failed (reasons: ...)".

**⚠ The ranking table must contain exactly `count_success` entries. If you find yourself writing a different number, STOP and re-verify.**

**Basic ranking:** Sort by affinity ascending (more negative = better).

**EquiScore rescoring (for Top candidates, up to 20 molecules).** Call `equiscore_pocket` → `equiscore_screen`. EquiScore scores are higher = better (opposite to Vina). Use rank fusion, not raw score addition.

**Post-EquiScore download:** Download any SDF files generated during EquiScore pocket extraction (`single_sdf_dir`). These are Category A files needed for interaction analysis.

**Interaction analysis (for final candidates, up to 10 molecules).** Run `molclaw-interaction-visualizer` on each top candidate's docking pose. For batch fingerprint comparison across all candidates simultaneously, optionally supplement with `prolif_docking`.

```bash
# Per-candidate deep analysis (PRIMARY — run for each top candidate)
python molclaw_interaction_visualizer.py \
    --receptor prepared.pdb --ligand candidate_pose.sdf \
    --mode ligand --out_dir viz_candidate_N \
    --resid_offset <offset> --score <vina_score> \
    --residue_roles_json roles.json --title "Target–Candidate_N"
```

Identify anchor interactions (from `summary_*.json` → `top_residues`) and modification candidates (from `*_partner_site.csv`).

### Residue Numbering (L3 Principle 17 — MANDATORY when task references specific residues)

**For interaction-visualizer:** Use `--resid_offset N` (N = UniProt − PDB). All CSV outputs automatically include `rec_resid_mapped` column.

**MAPPING GATE — Execute BEFORE interpreting results if the task references specific residues:**

1. Retrieve the numbering scheme info from Skill 1 output.
2. Compute the offset: `offset = UniProt_number − PDB_number`. Use the deployed `residue_mapper` MCP tool if needed.
3. When reporting results, ALWAYS specify the numbering scheme:
   - CORRECT: "Interaction visualizer detected HBond at ALA145 (rec_resid_pdb=145, rec_resid_mapped=719 with offset +574 = Ala719 PDB 1M17 = Ala743 UniProt P00533)"
   - WRONG: "Interaction visualizer detected HBond at ALA145" (ambiguous — which numbering?)
4. When verifying task-specified residues (e.g., "confirm Met793 interaction"), check the `rec_resid_mapped` column directly.

### Post-Analysis Image Download (L3 Principle 15 — MANDATORY)

Download ALL interaction-visualizer output images for each candidate:
- `diagram2d_*.png` — Schrödinger-style 2D interaction diagram
- `residue_bar_*.png` — residue stacked bar chart
- `pymol_*_{front,side,top}.png` — 3D renderings (if PyMOL available)
- `summary_*.json` — decision-ready JSON

### Screening Funnel Summary (MANDATORY — all counts file-verified)

| Tier | Input count (verified) | Output count (verified) | Eliminated | Elimination reasons | Verified by |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------|----|
| Validation | N₀ | N₁ | N₀−N₁ | invalid SMILES: Z | `is_valid_smiles` count |
| Property filter | N₁ | N₂ | N₁−N₂ | Lipinski>2: X; QED<0.2: Y | `wc -l filtered_list` |
| Format conversion | N₂ | N₃ | N₂−N₃ | Conversion failure: W | Count successful conversions |
| Docking | N₃ | N₄ | N₃−N₄ | Docking failure: X; score > 0: Y | Count negative scores in output |
| EquiScore | N₄ | N₅ | N₄−N₅ | Low EquiScore (<0.4): X | Count filtered EquiScore results |

**Every count in this table must be programmatically verified against actual files, not recalled from memory (L3 Principle 11).**

## Phase 7: Iteration Protocol (L3 Principles 4–5)

If the first round of screening yields no satisfactory candidates (e.g., all docking scores above −6.0 kcal/mol, or no candidates pass both Vina and EquiScore thresholds), do NOT simply report failure. Execute the following diagnostic-and-retry loop:

**Before each retry round, explicitly answer three questions (L3 Principle 5):**

1. **What went wrong?** Diagnose using data: Was the pocket wrong (check if known actives for this target also score poorly)? Is the library chemically mismatched for this target (e.g., all hydrophilic molecules for a hydrophobic pocket)? Were filtering thresholds too strict? Was the docking box too small (check if progressive enlargement was tried)?

2. **What will change this round?** Specify the concrete modification: Try alternative pocket (if dual detection found two); relax property filters and re-run; generate new molecules with REINVENT (invoke Skill 4) targeting the identified pocket properties; **increase docking box size if not already at the QuickVina2-GPU maximum of 47.625 Å**; switch docking method to KarmaDock.

3. **How will success be measured?** Define the criterion: at least 3 molecules with Vina < −7.0 kcal/mol; or at least 1 molecule with EquiScore > 0.6.

**Maximum retry rounds:** 2 additional rounds beyond the initial screen. If still unsatisfactory after 3 total rounds, report the best available results with honest analysis of why screening was challenging.

## Common Failures & Recovery

| Failure | Likely cause | Recovery |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| All docking scores positive | Wrong pocket; receptor PDBQT corrupt; box too small | Re-detect pocket; re-convert receptor; **try progressive box enlargement 25→30→40→47.625 Å** |
| `convert_smiles_to_format` fails for many molecules | Complex stereochemistry or charged species | Try alternative representation; generate 3D with RDKit first |
| EquiScore and Vina rankings completely disagree | Different binding modes scored; possible incorrect pose | Re-dock top EquiScore hits; inspect poses visually via interaction-visualizer 2D diagram |
| Multiple molecules return identical scores (e.g., all 0.0) | Systematic setup error | Check receptor format, box definition, and ligand preparation |
| Interaction residue IDs don't match task-specified residues | Numbering scheme mismatch (`--resid_offset` wrong or not set) | Recompute offset; check `rec_resid_mapped` column; **execute residue mapping protocol (L3 Principle 17)** before concluding interaction is absent |

### Post-Execution Learning Check

After completing the screening workflow, if the agent encountered any of the following, evaluate crystallization triggers per L3 Principle 25.5:
- A novel tool composition not standard in this workflow (e.g., combining conformational ensemble with per-conformation docking)
- A failure-recovery pattern not in the failure table above
- A parameter configuration that significantly improved hit rates over default settings
