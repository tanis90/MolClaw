# Peptide and Protein Binder Design Workflow

## Applicability

**Use this skill when:** Designing peptides or protein binders that must bind a specific target protein at a defined site.

**Do NOT use this skill when:** Generating peptide sequences without a specific binding target (use Skill 4 Mode E); improving a protein's own stability/solubility without binding requirements (use Skill 10).

## Prerequisites

| Input | Source | Required? |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Target protein structure | Skill 1 `prepared_pdb` | Yes |
| Target protein sequence | Skill 1 `fasta_path` | Yes (for EvoBind) |
| Binding site residues | User or Skill 1 pocket detection | Recommended |
| Numbering scheme info | Skill 1 `numbering_scheme` | Required (for residue mapping) |

## Scene Classification

**Scene A: De novo targeted peptide design (8–20 residues).** Core tool: `evobind_tool`.

**Scene B: Known peptide optimization.** Core tools: `proteinmpnn_tool` + `pepinvent_peptide_sampling_by_peptide`.

**Scene C: Protein binder design (> 50 residues).** Core tools: Chroma (`chroma_monomer` / `chroma_complex` / `chroma_symmetry`) → `proteinmpnn_tool`. See L1 skill `molclaw-chroma-toolkit` for which Chroma tool to use.

## Residue Numbering Pre-Check (L3 Principle 17 — Execute Before Any Design)

**If the task specifies target binding site residues by number:** Immediately determine which numbering scheme those numbers use (usually UniProt or literature), and establish the mapping to the structure's numbering scheme. Record in `run_log.md`. All subsequent references to binding site residues must use the structure's numbering when calling tools, and the task's numbering when reporting results.

## Scene A: EvoBind Peptide Design

### Step 1: Prepare Target FASTA
Extract the target protein sequence from Skill 1 output. Write to a FASTA file.

<!-- NEW: Optional LR known binding motif retrieval -->
### Optional: Known Binding Motif Retrieval (if LR tools are available)

Before defining the binding region, search for experimentally characterized protein-protein interactions at the target interface:

1. PubMed search: `"[target name] protein-protein interaction interface peptide"` (retmax=10)
2. Note: known hotspot residues, binding motifs, solved co-crystal structures with peptide ligands
3. If known peptide binders exist, retrieve their sequences for comparison with designed peptides after Step 4
4. Key findings inform `target_residues` selection in Step 2 — literature-reported interface hotspots can supplement or validate computational pocket/hotspot predictions
5. Record in `run_log.md`: `[LR] Known PPI motifs for [target]: [summary with PMID]`

**If LR tools are not available**, skip this step. Rely on computational methods (FoldX, fpocket, MMPBSA decomposition) for binding region definition.

### Step 2: Define Binding Region
`target_residues` defines where the peptide should bind. Sources (in priority order):
- User-specified residue range (highest priority) — **translate to structure numbering if needed**
- PPI interface hotspot residues (from Skill 6 per-residue decomposition)
- FoldX AlaScan interface hotspot residues: run `foldx_tool mode=alascan` with `chains` on a known complex structure → select residues with ΔΔG(Ala) > 1.0 kcal/mol as target_residues (faster than MMPBSA, minutes vs hours)
- fpocket/P2Rank pocket residue list
- `"all"` — search the full surface (slower)

### Step 3: Execute EvoBind

| Parameter | Conservative | Standard (default) | Aggressive |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| `peptide_length` | 8–10 | 12 | 15–20 |
| `num_designs` | 5 | 10 | 20 |
| `num_iterations` | 50 | 100 | 200 |
| `cyclic` | False | False | True |

### Step 4: Initial Screening

Sort by ipTM: > 0.8 = high confidence; 0.6–0.8 = moderate; < 0.6 = low. Select candidates with ipTM > 0.6.

**⚠ COUNT GATE (L3 Principle 11):** Verify the actual number of designs returned:
```
EvoBind output verification:
- Requested: num_designs = 20
- Actual designs returned: [count from output file]
- Designs with ipTM > 0.6: [count]
```

## Scene C: Protein Binder Design (Full Sub-Workflow)

### Step C1: Generate Binder Scaffold with Chroma
Call the appropriate Chroma tool (`chroma_complex` for binder design with target context, or `chroma_monomer` for standalone backbone generation) to generate protein backbones. `num_samples`: 5–10 scaffolds. See L1 skill `molclaw-chroma-toolkit` for parameter details.

**Post-generation download (L3 Principle 14):** Download ALL generated scaffold PDB files.

### Step C2: Design Sequence with ProteinMPNN
For each scaffold, call `proteinmpnn_tool`:
- `chains_to_design`: binder chain only (fix target chain)
- `model_name`: "v_48_020"
- `use_soluble`: True
- `num_seq_per_target`: 3–5
- `sampling_temp`: "0.1 0.2"

### Step C3: Proceed to validation (same pipeline as below)

## Multi-Layer Validation (All Scenes)

### Validation Layer 1: Chai-1 Independent Structure Prediction (L3 Principle 9)

**Why this is mandatory:** EvoBind's ipTM is a design score, not an independent prediction.

Call `chai1_predict` with `mode="sequence"`, providing both target and designed sequences:
```
seq="TARGET_SEQUENCE,DESIGNED_SEQUENCE"
name="Target,Binder"
samples=5
```

**Evaluation:**
- Chai-1 ipTM > 0.7 → validation passed
- Chai-1 ipTM 0.5–0.7 → marginal
- Chai-1 ipTM < 0.5 → validation failed; redesign

### Mandatory Chai-1 Structure Download (L3 Principle 14 — CRITICAL)

**Download the predicted complex structure** from Chai-1 output:
```python
response = await client.session.call_tool(
    "server_file_to_base64",
    arguments={"file_path": chai1_result["output_structure"]}
)
# Save as stepNN_chai1_complex.pdb/cif
```
**This is a Category A file — essential for downstream interaction analysis, user verification, and visualization.**

### Validation Layer 2: HDOCK Docking Verification

If both target 3D structure and binder/peptide monomer structure are available:
- Call `hdock_tool` for protein-peptide/protein docking
- Evaluate HDOCK score (more negative = better)

### Mandatory HDOCK Structure Download (L3 Principle 14)

**Download the HDOCK docked complex PDB:**
```python
hdock_complex = hdock_result["output_files"]["best_model_pdb"]
hdock_partner_chain = hdock_result["partner_chains"][0]
response = await client.session.call_tool(
    "server_file_to_base64",
    arguments={"file_path": hdock_complex}
)
# Save as stepNN_hdock_complex.pdb
```

### Validation Layer 3: Interface Interaction Analysis (interaction-visualizer — PRIMARY)

Run `molclaw-interaction-visualizer` in peptide mode on the validated complex structure (Chai-1 or HDOCK output):

```bash
python molclaw_interaction_visualizer.py \
    --complex chai1_complex.pdb --mode peptide \
    --partner_chain <hdock_partner_chain_or_known_chai1_partner_chain> --out_dir viz_out \
    --resid_offset <offset> --title "PeptideBinder-Target"
```

**Residue Numbering (L3 Principle 17):**
Use `--resid_offset N` so all CSV outputs include mapped residue numbers. The Chai-1 predicted complex uses sequential numbering starting from 1 — this is NOT UniProt numbering. Compute the offset before invoking.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Target: 3–8 interface hydrogen bonds for a good peptide binder (check `interaction_type_counts.HBond` in `summary_*.json`)
- Check: peptide contacts the originally specified `target_residues` (verify in `rec_resid_mapped` column)
- Identify anchor interactions to preserve in optimization (from `top_residues` in summary JSON)

**Outputs:** `interface_heatmap_*.png` (interface quality assessment), `interface_network_*.png` (interface topology), `residue_bar_*.png`, `summary_*.json` → `top_residues` to identify anchor residues for Round 2 ProteinMPNN fixation.

**Fallback: ProLIF** (only if interaction-visualizer script is unavailable on compute node): Call `prolif_pdb` on the complex. Note that ProLIF requires MCP server and does not produce interface heatmap or network visualizations for single structures.

### Mandatory Interaction Image Download (L3 Principle 15)

Download ALL interaction-visualizer output images:
- `interface_heatmap_*.png`, `interface_network_*.png`, `residue_bar_*.png` (all PNG)
- `summary_*.json` — decision-ready JSON
- If ProLIF was also used: interaction heatmap, frequency barplot

### Validation Layer 3B: FoldX Interface Energy (Optional, Recommended)

For quantitative energy assessment of the designed peptide–target interface:

1. Run FoldX RepairPDB on the Chai-1 predicted complex.
2. Run FoldX AnalyseComplex:

```python
response = await client.session.call_tool("foldx_tool", arguments={
    "mode": "analysecomplex",
    "pdb_path": foldx_repaired_chai1_complex,
    "chains": "A,B"   # target_chain, peptide_chain — check actual IDs
})
result = client.parse_result(response)
interaction_energy = result["metrics"]["interaction_energy"]
```

Interpretation: interaction_energy < −5 kcal/mol suggests a stable interface. Compare across candidates for ranking. This provides physics-based evidence independent of Chai-1 ipTM.

### Validation Layer 4: Sequence Property Assessment

Call `calculate_protein_sequence_properties`:
- Instability index < 40 → likely stable
- GRAVY: negative → better solubility

**Peptide-specific qualitative assessment (labeled as Category 2 — agent analysis, not tool computation):**
- Protease susceptibility: peptides rich in Arg/Lys are more susceptible to trypsin-like proteases
- Membrane permeability: cyclic peptides with N-methylation have better permeability
- Immunogenicity: longer peptides (>15 residues) have higher immunogenicity risk

Label these as "qualitative assessment based on sequence features (agent analysis)" — not computational predictions.

## Iteration Protocol (L3 Principles 4–6)

### Before each round, answer three questions (L3 Principle 5):
1. **What needs improvement?** Cite verified data: "Round 1 best peptide has Chai-1 ipTM of only 0.55 (verified from tool return); need stronger interface complementarity."
2. **What strategy?** "Increase peptide length by 3 residues; switch to cyclic=True."
3. **How to measure?** "Chai-1 ipTM > 0.7; HDOCK score < −200."

### Iteration schedule:

**Round 1 (Exploration):** EvoBind with `num_designs=20, num_iterations=50`. Select ipTM > 0.6. Chai-1 validation on these.
- **⚠ Verify actual design count from output file.**
- **Download all Chai-1 complex structures.**

**Round 2 (Focused optimization):** For best Round 1 candidate(s):
- ProteinMPNN sequence optimization: fix key interface residues (identified by interaction-visualizer in Round 1, from `top_residues` in summary JSON)
- **Alternative: FoldX PSSM for energy-guided affinity maturation.** Run `foldx_tool mode=pssm` on the Chai-1 predicted complex with `positions` set to peptide interface residues and `chains` set to the target/peptide chain partition. The PSSM matrix directly shows which amino acid substitution at each interface position gives the most favorable ΔΔG_interaction. Combine top substitutions and re-validate with Chai-1.
- Try `cyclic=True` if Round 1 used linear
- **⚠ Verify design count. Download structures.**

**Round 3 (Fine-tuning):** Adjust peptide length; refine target_residues based on Round 2 interaction-visualizer data (mapped via `rec_resid_mapped`); try `use_soluble=True` + `omit_aas="CMX"`.
- **⚠ Verify counts. Download structures and images.**

**Convergence:** Stop when Chai-1 ipTM > 0.7 for at least one candidate; or when ipTM has not improved for 2 rounds; or after 4 rounds maximum.

### Round-Level Verification (L3 Principle 12 Checkpoint B)

Before writing any round summary:
```
### Round N Verification
- Designs generated: [verified count from file]
- ipTM scores: [verified from tool returns]
- Chai-1 validation ipTM: [verified from tool return]
- Structure files downloaded: [list]
- Image files downloaded: [list]
- All data verified: ✅
```

## Common Failures & Recovery

| Failure | Likely cause | Recovery |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| All EvoBind designs ipTM < 0.5 | Challenging target surface | Increase length to 15–20; try cyclic; try different target_residues |
| Chai-1 places peptide at wrong site | Sequence ambiguous about location | Redesign with more iterations |
| HDOCK gives very weak scores | Peptide doesn't fold alone | Expected; rely more on Chai-1 ipTM |
| Interaction residue IDs don't match task | Numbering mismatch (`--resid_offset` wrong) | **Recompute offset; check `rec_resid_mapped` column** |
