# Multi-Target Selectivity Assessment Workflow

## Applicability

**Use this skill when:** The user has multiple target proteins (homologous or sharing a common binding site topology, e.g., CDK2/CDK4/CDK6, EGFR/VEGFR2, JAK1/JAK2/JAK3) and candidate molecules, and needs to assess binding across targets, optimize selectivity, or verify dual/multi-target activity.

**Do NOT use this skill when:** There is only one target (use Skill 2); the targets share no structural similarity in the binding region (e.g., a kinase and a GPCR — perform independent Skill 2 docking per target without cross-target alignment); or the task is optimizing selectivity without initial docking data (start with Skill 2).

**Integration with Skill 5 Scene D:** When this skill is invoked as a sub-step within Skill 5's multi-target iterative loop, the cross-docking matrix and selectivity-determining residues feed directly into Skill 5's Step 2 (diagnosis and design). The "bottleneck target" (worst-performing target relative to its threshold) from this skill's output determines which target Skill 5 prioritizes in the next round.

## Prerequisites

| Input | Source | Required? |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Multiple target protein structures | Skill 1 `prepared_pdb` (one per target) | Yes |
| Numbering scheme info per target | Skill 1 `numbering_scheme` (one per target) | Required |
| Candidate molecule SMILES | User or Skill 2/4/5 output | Yes |
| Known experimental selectivity data | User or literature | Optional |

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Multi-Target Structure Preparation

For each target protein, execute Skill 1 independently. Record for each:
- Structure source and resolution
- Conformational state
- Whether a co-crystal ligand was present
- **Numbering scheme** (L3 Principle 17 — CRITICAL)

### Cross-Target Residue Alignment (L3 Principles 13 + 17 — MUST be computationally derived)

**⚠ This is a COMPUTATION-FIRST step.** The cross-target alignment must be derived from actual sequence/structural data, NOT from LLM training knowledge about protein families.

**Method 1 (preferred): Programmatic sequence alignment.**
```python
# Extract sequences from both target PDB files
# Align using the residue_mapper MCP tool or simple positional alignment
# Build cross-target correspondence table
```

**Method 2: DBREF-based UniProt mapping.**
For each target, extract the DBREF record → UniProt residue mapping. Then align via shared UniProt residue numbers.

**Method 3: `residue_mapper` MCP tool with shared UniProt ID (if available).**
If homologous targets map to different UniProt IDs (e.g., CDK2 = P24941, CDK4 = P11802), build separate UniProt mappings, then align by conserved positions using sequence comparison.

**Build a cross-target alignment table:**

```
## Cross-Target Residue Alignment
| Functional role | Target 1 (UniProt/PDB/tool) | Target 2 (UniProt/PDB/tool) | Conservation |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Gatekeeper | Thr790/Thr766/Thr122 (EGFR) | Thr315/Thr315/Thr47 (ABL) | Different AA |
| Hinge | Met793/Met769/Met125 (EGFR) | Met318/Met318/Met50 (ABL) | Conserved |
```

**Record the alignment table in `run_log.md` with the derivation method.** This table is essential for all downstream selectivity interpretation.

**⚠ FORBIDDEN:** Using LLM knowledge to state "the gatekeeper residue in CDK2 is Phe80" without computationally verifying this from the actual structure files. Even if correct, the information must be traced to a computational source.

### Step 2: Independent Pocket Detection Per Target

For each target, run both `fpocket_toolkit` and `pred_pocket_prank` (L3 Principle 3).

Verify that pocket residues in each target map to the same alignment positions.

### Step 3: Cross-Docking

Dock ALL candidate molecules against ALL target pockets using QuickVina.

**Docking parameter consistency (L3 Principle 18):**
- Use **identical parameters** across all targets: same box size (≥ 25 Å per dimension), same exhaustiveness.
- Document these parameters explicitly.
- If the pocket sizes differ significantly between targets, use the LARGER box size for ALL targets.

### Mandatory Cross-Docking Pose Download (L3 Principle 14 — CRITICAL)

**Download docking pose files for ALL (molecule × target) combinations:**
```python
for target in targets:
    for molecule in molecules:
        # Download pose PDBQT
        local_path = f"step{N}_{molecule_id}_{target_name}_pose.pdbqt"
        # ... server_file_to_base64 → local save → verify size > 0
```

**⚠ COUNT GATE (L3 Principle 11):** After cross-docking, verify the complete docking matrix:
```
Cross-docking verification:
- Molecules: M (verified)
- Targets: T (verified)
- Expected combinations: M × T = X
- Successful dockings: Y (verified by counting negative-score results)
- Failed dockings: X - Y (listed with reasons)
```

**Record the complete docking matrix with verified scores:**

| Molecule | Target 1 Vina | Target 2 Vina | Target 3 Vina | ΔScore (T1−T2) | ΔScore (T1−T3) |
|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Mol A | −8.5 | −6.2 | −7.1 | **−2.3** | −1.4 |
| Mol B | −7.8 | −7.5 | −7.3 | −0.3 | −0.5 |

### Step 4: Multi-Method Selectivity Scoring

**EquiScore cross-validation:** Run EquiScore on ALL (molecule × target) combinations. Compare Vina-based and EquiScore-based selectivity rankings.

**Boltz-2 binding probability (optional):** Predict binding probability for each pair.

**Download structure files from Boltz-2/EquiScore** (L3 Principle 14).

### Step 5: Interaction Fingerprint Differential Analysis

For each candidate molecule, run `molclaw-interaction-visualizer` on its docking pose in EACH target:

```bash
# For Target 1
python molclaw_interaction_visualizer.py \
    --receptor target1_prepared.pdb --ligand candidate_target1.sdf \
    --mode ligand --out_dir viz_target1 \
    --resid_offset <target1_offset> --score <vina_score> \
    --residue_roles_json target1_roles.json --title "Target1–Candidate"

# For Target 2 (same candidate, different target)
python molclaw_interaction_visualizer.py \
    --receptor target2_prepared.pdb --ligand candidate_target2.sdf \
    --mode ligand --out_dir viz_target2 \
    --resid_offset <target2_offset> --score <vina_score> \
    --residue_roles_json target2_roles.json --title "Target2–Candidate"
```

The `--residue_roles_json` can be customized per target to highlight target-specific functional residues (e.g., different gatekeeper residues), enabling visual side-by-side comparison of interaction patterns.

### Residue Numbering for Cross-Target Analysis (L3 Principle 17 — CRITICAL)

**This is the most error-prone step in multi-target selectivity analysis.** Different target PDB files almost certainly use different numbering schemes. The interaction-visualizer's `--resid_offset` maps each target's PDB numbering to UniProt independently, but cross-target comparison still requires alignment.

**MAPPING GATE — Execute for EACH target's output:**
1. Set correct `--resid_offset` per target so `rec_resid_mapped` reflects UniProt numbering.
2. Align `rec_resid_mapped` across targets using the cross-target alignment table from Step 1.
3. Compare interactions at the SAME alignment positions across targets.

CORRECT: "Interaction visualizer detected HBond at Ala145 (Target1, rec_resid_mapped=743) = Ala743 UniProt. In Target2, the aligned position is Pro298 UniProt (rec_resid_mapped=298). No HBond at Pro298 in Target2. This position (Ala743→Pro298) is a selectivity-determining residue."

WRONG: "Interaction visualizer detected HBond at Ala145 in Target1 but not in Target2." (Without mapping, Ala145 in Target1 and Ala145 in Target2 are NOT necessarily the same position.)

### Cross-Target Programmatic Comparison

Parse `summary_*.json` from each target and compare:
- `top_residues` lists (after alignment-position mapping) → target-specific vs. conserved contacts
- `interaction_type_counts` → differential interaction profiles
- `hot_partner_sites` → ligand atoms that interact differently across targets

### Post-Analysis Image Download (L3 Principle 15)

Download ALL interaction-visualizer output images for ALL targets:
- `diagram2d_*.png` — per-target 2D diagrams for side-by-side comparison
- `residue_bar_*.png`, `pymol_*_{front,side,top}.png`

**Optional supplement:** For batch fingerprint comparison across many candidates × targets simultaneously, also run `prolif_docking` and download ProLIF heatmaps.

**Analysis checklist:**
- **Target-specific interactions:** Present in desired target, ABSENT in off-targets → selectivity basis
- **Off-target-specific interactions:** Present in off-targets, absent in desired target
- **Conserved interactions:** Present in all targets → not relevant to selectivity

**Selectivity-determining residues:** Positions where BOTH (a) amino acid identity differs AND (b) interaction fingerprint differs. Identify using the cross-target alignment table.

### Step 6: Selectivity Optimization Recommendations

Based on Step 5's differential analysis (grounded in tool-computed data — L3 Principle 13):
- Which modifications enhance interactions with target-specific residues?
- Which modifications introduce clashes with off-target-specific residues?
- Are there packing differences to exploit?

**Computation-first rule:** Optimization recommendations must cite specific interaction-visualizer-identified interactions (from `summary_*.json`) and cross-target alignment positions. CORRECT: "Extending the molecule toward alignment position 523 (Thr in Target1, Lys in Target2) could exploit the size difference." WRONG: "Kinase selectivity is typically achieved through exploiting the gatekeeper residue" (generic LLM knowledge).

### Step 7: Experimental Data Comparison (if available)

If experimental IC₅₀ data is available:
- Compare computed selectivity DIRECTION with experimental direction
- **⚠ Do NOT compute selectivity fold-change from docking scores** (L3 Principle 9). ΔG = RT·ln(Kd) requires exact free energies; docking scores are approximations. Only the ranking direction is meaningful.
- If directions agree → high confidence. If disagree → discuss causes.

## Iteration Protocol

If initial cross-docking shows no selectivity:
1. **Diagnose:** Are pocket residues identical across targets?
2. **Try alternative pockets:** Check allosteric sites.
3. **Design for selectivity:** Use selectivity-determining residues to guide Skill 5 or Skill 4.
4. **Re-assess:** Re-run cross-docking with new molecules.

## Common Failures & Recovery

| Failure | Likely cause | Recovery |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| ΔScores all near zero | Pocket sequences very conserved | Focus on allosteric sites; design larger molecules |
| Docking fails for one target | Structure quality issue | Re-prepare; try different PDB; use predicted structure |
| Interaction profiles identical across targets | Box too small; peripheral differences missed | Increase docking box; include 2nd-shell residues |
| Cross-target residue comparison incorrect | Numbering mismatch | **Rebuild cross-target alignment table from scratch** |
